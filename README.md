# Game Of Life
It is a simulation of Conway's Game Of Life

The Game of Life belongs to a class of applications called Generative Apps. 
With generative apps we typically set up initial conditions, like we set here is GOL begining with live/dead cells and then let an algorithm drive the behaviour from there. 
Generative apps generate results that are interesting and often surprising.

## Rules

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (under-population).  
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on.  
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (overcrowding).  
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction).
