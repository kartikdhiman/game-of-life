# Game Of Life
It is a simulation of Conway's Game Of Life

The Game of Life belongs to a class of applications called Generative Apps. 
With generative apps we typically set up initial conditions, like we set here is GOL begining with live/dead cells and then let an algorithm drive the behavior from there. 
Generative apps generate results that are interesting and often surprising.

## Rules

1. Any living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies (underpopulation).  
2. Any living cell with two or three living neighbors lives on.  
3. Any living cell with more than three living neighbors dies (overcrowding).  
4. Any dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes a living cell (reproduction).
